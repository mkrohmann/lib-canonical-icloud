lib-canonical-icloud
====================

Normalizes any email address on an Apple server to its simplest canonical representation so that it can be compared against other canonical email addresses.

The canonical address should not be stored in stead of the user's inputed address, as some folks use these modifications to route their incoming email to particular folders.
